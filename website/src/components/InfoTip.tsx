/**
 * Small info glyph that reveals a help tip.
 *
 * One pattern for every surface, so a reader learns it once:
 *   - mouse:    hover shows the tip, leaving it (glyph and bubble) hides it;
 *   - keyboard: focus shows it, Escape hides it, blur hides it;
 *   - touch:    a tap pins it, another tap (or a tap elsewhere) unpins it.
 * A click pins on any input, which is also how a mouse reader keeps a long tip
 * open while moving the pointer. While the tip is shown it is the glyph's
 * accessible DESCRIPTION (`aria-describedby`); while hidden, the same text sits
 * on `title`, the native fallback that is also what assistive technology falls
 * back to for a description -- so the help is attached whether or not the tip
 * is open, and nothing of it is in the body copy until it is. The `title` is
 * dropped the moment the tip shows, so the browser's own tooltip never doubles
 * it. Portal-rendered to escape overflow clipping.
