"""The user's own ``allowedTools`` entries survive a conductor spec regeneration.

The conductor installers run on every ``rebuild_agent_config`` -- every gateway start
-- and an installer that rebuilt ``allowedTools`` from its grant tuple and wrote the
file without reading it would leave an entry the user approved on
``kirocrew-conductor.json`` (or the pipeline, security or ledger-alias spec) gone at
the next start, silently, while ``toolsSettings`` carried over. ``kirocrew.json``
keeps the user's list on an existing install; these tests pin that the four conductor
specs do too, the way that list does: the user's entries are kept, the shipped grants
are re-added, the governance ceiling still removes what it forbids, and nothing is
dropped -- or kept -- without a log line or an audit event naming it.

What tells a user's entry apart from Crew's own is the history of every grant any
release has shipped on the spec (``conductor_agents._SHIPPED_GRANT_HISTORY``): an
entry it names is Crew's and is kept exactly when this release ships it; an entry it
does not name is the user's and survives. Without it an add-only merge would keep
every grant an earlier release shipped and a later one deliberately stopped shipping
-- the goal conductor's core grant is named verbs where an earlier release's was a
bare ``@kirocrew-core``, and that narrowing has to reach existing installs. The one
cost is pinned too: a grant Crew once shipped and has since retired, hand-re-added by
a user, reads as Crew's and goes, loudly.

A spec that is present but unreadable is not "no spec", and what happens to it
follows the reader's two failure classes: bytes that can never be a spec are written
over (nothing loadable was there to keep, and leaving them would leave kiro-cli
without the conductor and the ceiling with nothing to re-filter), while a read that
may succeed next time leaves the user's file exactly where it is -- and the installer
says it wrote nothing, so a moved ceiling stays pending instead of being marked
projected onto a list that was never rewritten.
