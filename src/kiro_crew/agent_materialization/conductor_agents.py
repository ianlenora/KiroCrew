    granting it IS the explicit per-agent assignment that set requires.

    The two fields that are easy to forget are why this is a helper rather than
    three copies: without ``"type": "registry"`` a registry-mode client silently
    DROPS the entry, so the granted session-control tools never launch and the

    session store than the one it reports on. Both helpers return empty on a

# -- Every grant any release has shipped on the four conductor specs -------------
#
# THIS TABLE IS THE PROVENANCE. A generated conductor spec is rewritten on every
# ``rebuild_agent_config``, and the file on disk is the only place a user's own
# ``allowedTools`` entries live: nothing in the file says which entries the
# installer wrote and which the user added. The history does: an on-disk entry
# some release shipped on that spec is Crew's -- kept exactly when the current
# release ships it, under the ceiling -- and an entry no release ever shipped is
# the user's and survives. The one thing this cannot tell apart is a user who
# hand-adds a grant Crew once shipped and has since retired: that entry reads as
# Crew's and goes, loudly, and the tool it covered asks instead of being
# auto-approved -- the direction a safety list fails in.
#
# Reconstructed from every commit of the installers since the first conductor:
# the grant tuples and installer literals at each commit, resolved per spec (the
# pull request body of the change that introduced this table lists each grant
# with the change that shipped it and, where one did, the change that retired it).
# LITERAL on purpose -- not derived from the current tuples -- because the list's
# one job is to still name a grant after a release stops shipping it: derived
# from the current tuples, a retired grant would leave the history the moment it
# was retired and read as the user's, which is the very bug this module exists to
# close. A test pins that every grant the installers write today is listed here,
# so a NEW grant cannot land without being added; a retirement needs no step at
# all, which is the direction a safety list wants.

    """The ``allowedTools`` list a conductor installer writes: the shipped grants, then
    the user's own entries on the spec it is about to replace, all under the ceiling.
    ``None`` when the spec on disk must not be replaced at all (below).

    Every ``rebuild_agent_config`` -- every gateway start, a provider switch, an MCP
    change -- re-runs the installers. An installer that rebuilt this list from its
    grant tuple alone and wrote the file without reading it would drop every
    approval the user had added, at the next start, silently, while
    ``toolsSettings`` carried over because nothing rewrites it. ``kirocrew.json``
    keeps the user's ``tools`` / ``allowedTools`` on an existing install (ADD-only,
    then the ceiling); this is that same merge, for the four conductor specs.

    Which entries on disk are the USER'S is the whole question, and the file cannot
    answer it: an entry is either the installer's or the user's and nothing in the
    JSON says which. The history of every grant any release has shipped on this
    spec (``_SHIPPED_GRANT_HISTORY``) answers it: an on-disk entry the history
    names is Crew's and is re-derived from *shipped* -- kept exactly when this
    release ships it -- and one it does not name is the user's and is carried
    forward. Without that history an add-only merge would keep every grant an
    earlier release shipped and this one deliberately does not -- the goal
    conductor's core grant is named verbs where an earlier release's was a bare
    ``@kirocrew-core``, and a narrowing like that reaches an existing install only
    if the installer can tell its own earlier output from the user's. The worker
    installer records the same objection and takes nothing but ``model`` from its
    previous file for want of such a record; here the history is the record, so a
    user's entry is kept and a retired grant still goes.

    The provenance contract, then: an entry on disk is the user's exactly when no
    release has ever shipped it on this spec. The history is kept in code rather
    than in a per-install record because it holds for ANY file at the spec's name
    -- one written by this release, by an earlier one (a downgrade and
    re-upgrade), by another install whose agents directory was copied here, or by
    a hand that edited an owned field -- with no second store to fall out of step
    with the spec, be torn by a failed write, or be hand-damaged into a wrong
    answer. What it costs is one case: a user who hand-adds a grant Crew once
    shipped and has since retired (the bare ``@kirocrew-core`` an early goal
    conductor shipped, the pipeline conductor's one-release work-ledger verbs)
    loses it at the next start, named in the WARNING and the SEL feed, and the
    tool it covered asks instead of being auto-approved -- the drop fails closed.
    What the history cannot name is a grant a NEWER release ships: on an install
    downgraded past it, that grant reads as the user's until the re-upgrade --
    bounded to a grant some release of this project chose to ship, never to one
    it retired. ``clean`` keeps nothing: ``kirocrew setup --agent-only --clean``
    is the explicit reset, and it resets these specs as it resets
    ``kirocrew.json``.

    A spec that is present and cannot be read is not "no spec", and what happens
    to it follows the reader's own two failure classes (``_SpecUnusable``). Bytes
    that can never be a spec -- not JSON, not an object, an ``allowedTools`` that
    is not a list, a planted or dangling link, a path outside the agents directory
    -- are written over, because nothing loadable is preserved by keeping them:
    kiro-cli would not load that file either, a conductor dispatched by name would
    resolve to the DEFAULT agent and its file-writing tool set, and a tightened
    ceiling could never be re-filtered onto the list. The WARNING names the cause
    and that no entry on the file was carried forward. A read that failed for a
    reason the reader calls transient (a permission or I/O error, a refused open)
    may stand before the user's intact spec, so that file is left exactly where it
    is (``None``), named in the WARNING, and the installer reports that it wrote
    nothing -- so a moved ceiling stays pending and is retried, rather than being
    marked projected onto a list that was never rewritten.

    Order: *shipped* first, as shipped, then the user's entries, so the spec reads
    as before for a user who added nothing and the tests that pin the shipped list
    stay literal. A shipped grant the user deleted comes back: narrowing a
    conductor is the governance ceiling's job (``POLICY ∩ PROFILE``), never a hand
    edit's, and that ceiling is applied here to the WHOLE merged list through
    ``_filter_auto_approve``, so a user's entry the ceiling forbids is withheld
    (and SEL-audited) exactly as a shipped one is -- the merge never widens the
    ceiling. Nothing on the list moves silently: one WARNING names every on-disk
    entry this install did not carry forward, a drop the ceiling did not make is a
    revoked auto-approval and lands in the SEL feed as one, and an entry of the
    user's that IS carried forward lands there too, as a retained one -- the
    decision that an auto-approval stays past a rebuild is a permission decision,
    and the feed is where those are read.

    ``agent_id`` used in the derive's log line and the spec on disk whose user
    entries are carried forward, and ``source`` names the installer in the
    withheld-grant audit event. ``clean`` is the rebuild's own flag, passed
    through: a clean rebuild carries nothing forward (``_governed_grants``).

    The charter, and why each property is a property of the SPEC rather than of
    the prompt. Derived from the kirocrew agent (resolved MCP invocations,
    security hooks) and narrowed to what conducting needs: session control,
    core tools, the work ledger, and shell for the bundled acceptance
    evaluator — and **no tool that can write a file**, not ``fs_write`` and not
    ``code`` either, which governance classes under ``filesystem.write``
    because it writes files and can shell out. That is what makes "never does a
    work item's work itself" true against the tool list and not just against
    the prose.

    ``@kirocrew-core``, ``@kirocrew-dashboard`` and ``@kirocrew-work`` are all
    MOUNTED whole but auto-approved only verb by verb, via
    ``_CONDUCTOR_CORE_GRANTS``, ``_CONDUCTOR_DASHBOARD_GRANTS`` and
    ``_LEDGER_CONDUCTOR_WORK_GRANTS`` (see their comments for the per-verb
    reasoning). Both backends honour a per-tool reference, so the narrowing is
    real rather than cosmetic: kiro-cli's ``is_tool_in_allowlist`` checks
    ``@server`` and then ``@server/<tool>``, and ``allowed_tools_to_permissions``
    maps the same entry to an exact KAS ``server/tool`` resource match.

    The line the split follows is stated as an invariant on those tuples, not as
    a taste call: a granted verb may CREATE or READ, never MUTATE something that
    already exists and is not the conductor's own. Reads and creates are granted
    because the patrol loop is nudge-driven and must not block on an approval
    nobody is there to give. ``session_stop`` (discards a peer's in-flight turn),
    ``session_send`` (runs text as a peer's turn) and ``chat_folder_move_session``
    (writes a peer session's ``folder_id``) are withheld, because the conductor
    ingests untrusted content by design and the server-side gates bound which
    target is reachable, not what is done to it. ``work_report`` is withheld on
    the same rule: it writes into a PARENT's record, across a dispatch
    relationship.

    ``execute_bash`` is withheld for a different reason that is worth keeping
    distinct: ``allowedTools`` is name-scoped with no argument matching, so
    trusting the one bundled script cannot be told apart from trusting arbitrary
    shell. There is no per-argument form of that grant the way there is a
    per-tool form of the MCP one.

    The operating procedure ships as the ``goal-conductor`` builtin skill, NOT
    ``conductor``: that directory name belonged to the delegation skill the
    retired ``agent.conductor_skill`` flag generated, and install cleanup still
    removes a ``<skills>/conductor/SKILL.md`` whose bytes the generator wrote on
    old installs. Sharing the name would let that cleanup erase the packaged
    skill.

    a side effect, and the decision has now been taken — the flow ran end to end
    (7 items across 3 rounds, each acceptance settled by the evaluator rather

    ``kirocrew-ledger-conductor`` stays for one release as a deprecated alias

    A third standalone installer, following ``_install_pipeline_conductor_agent``
    above for the same reason that one follows ``_install_conductor_agent`` — one
    installer per generated agent is this file's established pattern — and
    keeping every property those docstrings argue for: derived from the kirocrew

    apart from trusting arbitrary shell), and the KAS policy derived from the
    FILTERED grant list.

    Those properties carry more weight here than on either sibling, which is the
    charter difference: this agent's own children probe a security fence, so what
    it ingests on an unattended cycle is hostile by assumption. "Never touches the
    target itself" therefore has to hold as a spec property when nobody is at the
    keyboard, and the two human gates the prompt names (active testing beyond a
    local proof of concept, and any fixer dispatch) are what the withheld
    ``session_send`` / ``spawn_run`` / ``execute_bash`` grants make expensive to
    skip rather than merely discouraged.

    The grant tuples are the pipeline conductor's, REUSED rather than copied. The
    derivation the goal conductor's comment describes — the union of this prompt's
    own "Your tools:" inventory and the skill's real call sites, filtered to what
    registers on each server — lands on exactly that set here: patrol lifecycle,
    reads, the agent's own ledger, and owner reporting, with no ``select_crew``
    (this conductor routes nothing). A third byte-identical copy would be
    duplication whose later divergence nothing could detect, and reuse across
    agents is already this file's practice, and ``_filter_auto_approve`` plus
    ``_conductor_mcp_servers`` are the same argument applied one level down.

    ``@kirocrew-work`` is deliberately NOT mounted, matching
    ``kirocrew-pipeline-conductor``: the work-ledger flow belongs to
    ``kirocrew-conductor`` (``_conductor_spec``), and a conductor gaining tools that
    only make sense under a different procedure is a change to its charter rather
    than an addition to it. This agent's children report findings through the
    ``security-conductor`` skill's ledger scripts, not the work ledger, so the
    mount would grant a flow whose procedure this conductor does not run.
