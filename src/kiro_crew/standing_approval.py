"""The operator's STANDING declaration that every tool approval is skipped.

``SafetyOverride`` has two kinds of grant. An **ad-hoc** one is toggled mid-session
and expires on ``agent.yolo_duration``. A **declared** one is the operator's standing
instruction: it never expires, and it is re-established on every startup. This module
owns where that declaration is read from, and nothing else -- establishing the grant
stays with ``safety_override``.

Where the declaration lives, and why not ``config.json``
-------------------------------------------------------
``standing-approval/grant.json`` sits on the KEYSTONE floor
(``security._CREW_SECRET_LEAVES``) and is bind-masked out of every agent sandbox
(``sandbox._CREW_HIDDEN_LEAVES``). That is the same placement as
``computer_use.json``, ``aws_service_consent.json``, ``oauth_endpoints.json``,
``file_delivery_consent.json`` and ``ssh_auth_sock_consent.json``, and for the same
reason: this is an authorization, not a preference. It is the widest one the product
has -- every tool call in every future session, with no prompt and no expiry.

The declaration is deliberately NOT ``agent.dangerously_skip_permissions`` in
``config.json``. A read-only seal on that document closes a write to the sealed NAME,
and it is kept as defence in depth, but a seal cannot reach the inode behind the name:
the crew data-home root is writable in every sandbox, ``link(2)`` needs no write
permission on the file it copies a name for, and a bind mount seals a MOUNT rather
than an inode. So an in-sandbox process that owns that document can add a second name
for it in the writable root, write the standing posture through that name, and unlink
it -- and the next startup reads a poisoned document under a single link.

Two properties of this keystone answer that, and only the pair does:

* **Masked, not sealed.** A masked leaf cannot be opened in-sandbox at all, so it is
  not a ``link(2)`` source. A sealed-but-readable one still is.
* **A directory, not a file.** Linux refuses ``link(2)`` on a directory outright, so
  the alias shape has no source here even in principle, and a directory bind covers
  every child name rather than one pinned inode.

How the operator grants it
--------------------------
Like ``oauth_endpoints.json``, the operator writes the leaf out-of-band, from outside
the agent sandbox::

    mkdir -p "$KIROCREW_HOME/standing-approval"
    printf '{"dangerously_skip_permissions": true}\\n' \\
        > "$KIROCREW_HOME/standing-approval/grant.json"

There is deliberately no dashboard toggle (there never was one for this switch) and
no CLI verb: a surface that records this grant on request is a grant an automated
caller can take. This module is READ-ONLY on purpose.

Migrating an existing declaration
---------------------------------
An operator who set ``agent.dangerously_skip_permissions: true`` in ``config.json``
loses the standing grant until they write the keystone. That break is deliberate and
it is announced rather than silent: :func:`migration_notice` returns the words a
startup logs when the retired key is still set and the keystone is absent, and the
startup grants NOTHING in that state. Silently honouring the old location would keep
exactly the writable declaration this move exists to retire.

    """Read the grant document, refusing a link, a non-regular file or a second name.

    A plain ``read_text()`` follows a symlink, which would undo this leaf's whole
    point. The keystone directory is bind-masked and pre-created, so an in-sandbox
    process cannot place the link itself -- but an operator who aliases the document
    onto a sandbox-visible path (a dotfile manager is the ordinary way that happens)
    would hand the agent a writable name for the file that authorizes it. The reader
    refuses that shape rather than resolving it, which is the same disposition
    ``sandbox`` takes for a ceiling it cannot cover under a second name.

    Defences, in order, following :func:`session_pid_sig._read_regular_nofollow`:

    * ``O_NOFOLLOW | O_DIRECTORY`` on the PARENT directory, then an ``openat`` of the
      leaf relative to that pinned descriptor (``dir_fd``): ``O_NOFOLLOW`` on the leaf
      alone refuses a symlinked ``grant.json`` but NOT a symlinked ``standing-approval``
      directory, and the mask predicate matches by ``normpath`` without resolving links,
      so an operator-aliased directory (a dotfile manager is the ordinary way that
      happens) would still answer masked while handing the agent a writable parent for
      the file that authorizes it. Pinning the parent no-follow refuses the aliased
      directory at the open, and the dir_fd-relative open cannot traverse out of it.
    * ``O_NOFOLLOW`` (POSIX) on the leaf: the open itself refuses a symlink final
      component, race-free where an ``is_symlink()`` pre-check is not.
    * ``lstat`` pre-check plus a post-open identity check, for the one platform with
      no ``O_NOFOLLOW``: a link planted between the two opens its TARGET, whose
      ``(st_dev, st_ino)`` cannot match the vetted regular file.
    * ``S_ISREG``: rejects a FIFO or device at that name. ``O_NONBLOCK`` is in the
      open flags for that case specifically: a blocking ``O_RDONLY`` open of a FIFO
      with no writer never returns, so without it a FIFO planted at this name would
      hang the gateway's boot instead of being rejected by the check below. The flag
      is ignored for a regular file, which is every legitimate case.
    * ``st_nlink == 1``: a second hard link is a second writable name for this very
      inode, and the mask covers a path rather than an inode -- the exact shape this
      keystone exists to deny, so the reader must not accept a document carrying one.
    * A size bound checked against both ``fstat`` and the bytes actually read.

    **Why the deltas are not folded into that shared reader.**
    :func:`session_pid_sig._read_regular_nofollow` is read by ``session_pid_sig`` and
    ``session_token_sig``, and neither delta here is neutral for them. ``st_nlink == 1``
    is a REFUSAL, so folding it in refuses a legitimately hard-linked pid or token
    signature -- the ordinary output of a snapshot or dotfile tool, and harmless for those
    two because their documents are not authorizations: a second name for one grants
    nothing, while a second name for THIS one is the whole attack. Making the refusal
    conditional adds a parameter whose meaning is "be an authorization reader", which is
    this function under another name. ``O_NONBLOCK`` could fold on its own and would close
    a FIFO hang on that helper's own agent-writable mapping directory, but that changes
    two other modules' startup behaviour and belongs with whoever owns them rather than
    riding in on this leaf.

    Returns ``data`` on success -- the vetted document bytes -- and ``None`` on any
    refusal or I/O error, so every caller fails closed. The descriptor's release counts
    as part of the read: a failing ``close`` is caught here and resolves to no grant,
    because this reader runs on the gateway's startup thread outside any ``try``, so an
    error escaping it would abort boot instead of withholding a grant.

    The document's authority rests on the mask, not on its own contents: an agent
    subprocess that can see the real data home creates the directory and writes the
    grant itself, and the next startup reads what that subprocess wrote as the
    operator's standing authority. So the grant counts only where the mask holding
    the leaf out of an agent's reach is actually in force.

    Two predicates in :mod:`sandbox` already answer when the mask is skipped, and each
    says in its own docstring that a control whose security argument depends on the mask
    must not carry a copy of that reasoning. This composes them rather than re-spelling
    them, so a future branch that skips the mask is a change to them and reaches this
    grant for free:

    * :func:`sandbox.credential_mask_applies` answers whether ``wrap_argv`` would thread
      the hidden-dir set through the backend it selects for *requested_mode*. It owns the
      clamp to the governed floor, the ``off`` tier, the no-backend host, and the process
      already running inside a Crew sandbox -- that last one matters here because the
      outer sandbox deliberately leaves ``~/.aws``, ``~/.ssh`` and ``~/.kube`` readable
      and is not a substitute for an adapter-specific mask.
    * :func:`sandbox.spawn_delegates_masking` answers the different question that predicate
      cannot: on Windows, and on macOS with kiro-cli's internal sandbox enabled, the spawn
      is handed to kiro-cli. A backend is present, so the first predicate answers True, and
      yet none of Crew's masks are applied and the leaf is reachable from inside that
      confinement.

    What is left for this function is the one question neither of them asks: whether the
    keystone actually sits inside a path the masked target set names.

    **The platform consequence, stated rather than left to be discovered.** Crew's mask
    is a Linux bind mount or a macOS Seatbelt profile, so the standing grant is
    available on Linux with a working user namespace and on macOS where Crew's own
    Seatbelt runs. On Windows it is never available: there is no Windows backend for
    ``credential_mask_applies`` to find and the spawn is delegated there, so both
    predicates refuse. On macOS with kiro-cli's internal sandbox enabled it is likewise
    unavailable, because that configuration is exactly the delegation. This narrows what
    the declaration can do rather than what the retired config key could do -- that key
    grants nothing on ANY platform, so no host keeps a standing grant it could not hold.

    *requested_mode* is REQUIRED, and is the ``agent.sandbox`` value the caller already
    resolved: a startup must judge the document it is acting on rather than re-read
    configuration that may have moved underneath it, and every caller holds the value
    already, so a no-argument form would only be a second way to read it. It is passed
    through unclamped, because the clamp to the governed floor belongs to
    ``credential_mask_applies`` and applying it twice here would be the copy this
    function exists without: a floor raising a requested ``off`` to a confined tier is a
    masked host and keeps granting, and that predicate is where that is decided.

    ``normpath``, never ``realpath``: the target set is built with ``normpath`` for the
    reason :func:`sandbox._relocated_crew_targets` records, so a link-resolving syscall
    here could disagree with the rules the sandbox will actually install.

    Only a real ``bool`` ``True`` counts. A truthy string or number does not, for the
    reason ``config.sections._read_skip_permissions`` gives about the key it replaces:
    ``"false"``, ``"0"`` and ``"no"`` are all truthy in Python, so a bare ``bool(...)``
    here would read an explicit disable as the standing grant. LOCAL only -- no network.

    A declared document is honoured only where :func:`_keystone_is_masked` holds, so an
    agent subprocess that can reach the leaf cannot author its own standing authority.
    The mask is established only once the document already grants, so a host with no
    grant -- every default install -- pays nothing for the check and stays silent;
    a host that HAS one and cannot mask it says so, because an operator who wrote the
    document and still sees prompts needs the reason.

    **The bounded, upgrade-only residual -- stated, not closed.** The mask closes the
    ONGOING threat: on this version no agent subprocess can open or write the keystone, so
    no session can author its own standing authority. It does NOT close one bounded,
    one-time window: on a release BEFORE this leaf existed the crew data-home root was
    agent-writable and nothing masked ``standing-approval/``, so a hostile pre-upgrade
    agent could plant ``grant.json`` = ``True`` and wait for an upgrade to read it back.

    That window is accepted as a documented residual rather than papered over. Two earlier
    revisions tried to narrow it with on-disk state (a first-boot marker) and then with an
    in-memory live-observation layer; a first-principles review, a design review and the
    security reviewer agreed each was the wrong trade. No on-disk marker helps, because the
    pre-upgrade directory is agent-writable, so an attacker that plants ``grant.json`` can
    plant one more file to satisfy any marker check too. And the in-memory observation
    layer closed the plant only by refusing a grant merely PRESENT at boot, which killed
    the standing grant on every ordinary restart -- the capability this fix exists to
    preserve. Fully closing the window needs a trust root masked from the first release it
    shipped, to authenticate that on-disk state is gateway-written rather than planted, and
    no such root exists for the affected releases. So the honest posture is: close the
    ongoing threat with the mask, keep the grant RE-ESTABLISHED on every startup from the
    masked keystone, and name the residual exactly. It requires code execution on a PRIOR
    release AND an upgrade with the plant in place, and it never recurs once this version
    has run. An operator who did not run an auto-approved agent on a prior release is not
    exposed; an operator who is unsure removes ``standing-approval/`` once after upgrading
    and re-declares it.

    The whole value of this notice is that the person reading it can act on it without
    going to find the documentation first, so it names the resolved path and the one
    line to put in it. It deliberately does NOT hand over a runnable redirection
    command on any platform:

    * It does not spell the path as ``$KIROCREW_HOME/...``. That variable is unset on a
      default installation, where the data home comes from ``config_dir()``, so a shell
      expands the env-var form to ``/standing-approval`` and a command using it fails at
      the filesystem root.
    * It does not hand a Windows operator a POSIX one-liner. ``mkdir -p`` and ``printf``
      are not commands there, and POSIX single quotes are not quoting characters to
      ``cmd`` at all -- the same trap :func:`sandbox._delete_file_command` records.
    * It does not hand a POSIX operator a ``printf ... > path`` redirection either. A
      pre-upgrade agent can plant a symlink at the keystone path (the crew data-home
      root is agent-writable), and an operator who copy-pastes such a line would follow
      that symlink and overwrite the attacker's chosen target with operator privilege.
      So BOTH renderings name the path and the exact one line and ask the operator to
      create the file by hand -- no redirection this notice emits can be turned against
      them.

    The remedy is the SAME on every platform, so the wording is written once and
    resolved here rather than branched: *masked* selects the rendering, and
    *requested_mode* -- required, like :func:`is_declared`'s -- is what resolves it when
    *masked* is not given.

    **There are two renderings, and which one is right depends on the mask.** Where

    :func:`is_declared` refuses a declaration whose mask is absent -- so a remedy there
    would send the operator to create a file, watch the prompts continue, and have nothing
    further to read. That rendering states the unavailability and points at the ad-hoc
    duration, which is the grant that does work on such a host. It is also the correct text
    when the keystone is ALREADY written on an unmasked host, which is the case where a
